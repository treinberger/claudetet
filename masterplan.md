# Raffle System Application Masterplan

## Overview
A web-based raffle system that allows users to participate in raffles by answering questions and optionally purchasing additional winning chances with virtual currency (APoints). The system includes comprehensive admin functionality for managing raffles, users, and conducting prize draws.

## Target Audience
- **End Users**: Participants who will enter raffles and potentially use APoints for additional chances
- **Administrators**: Staff who will manage raffles, user accounts, and conduct draws

## Core Features and Functionality

### User Features
- Participate in available raffles by answering questions
- View all active raffles with teaser images
- Access detailed raffle information with full images
- Purchase additional winning chances using APoints (when enabled)
- Receive email notifications upon winning
- View personal raffle participation history

### Administrative Features
- Create and manage raffles with configurable parameters:
  - Basic info (name, description)
  - Images (teaser and detail view)
  - Question and answer options
  - Prize tiers and quantities
  - APoints configuration (cost and max purchases)
  - Timing (preview date, start date, end date)
- Manage user accounts:
  - View/edit user information
  - Adjust APoints balances
  - Manage account status
- Conduct raffle draws
- Access winner lists and exports

## Technical Stack Recommendations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular (to integrate with Allianz NDBX library)
- **UI Components**: Allianz NDBX library
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive capabilities for mobile browsers
- **Testing**: Unit tests for components and services

### Backend
- **Language**: Java
- **API**: RESTful API architecture with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Email Service**: Template-based email system for winner notifications
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test coverage for all business logic

### Database
- **Type**: SQLite (initial implementation)
- **Schema**: Well-documented database schema with proper indexing
- **Migration**: Version-controlled database migrations

### Documentation
- **API**: OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- **Database**: Entity-Relationship diagrams
- **Setup**: Detailed setup and deployment instructions
- **Testing**: Test coverage reports

## Security Considerations
- Secure authentication and authorization system
- Role-based access control (user vs admin)
- Protection against multiple participation attempts
- Secure APoints transaction handling
- Input validation for all user-submitted data
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- User authentication system
- Basic user profile management
- Admin dashboard foundation
- Database schema implementation
- Initial API documentation setup
- Core unit tests implementation

### Phase 2: Raffle Core
- Raffle creation and management
- Basic raffle participation
- Question/answer system
- Raffle listing and detail views
- Expand unit test coverage

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- APoints integration
- Additional chances purchase system
- Drawing algorithm implementation
- Winner notification system
- Export functionality
- Complete API documentation

### Phase 4: Polish
- Email template system
- UI/UX refinements
- Performance optimization
- Testing and security audits
- Documentation finalization

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Drawing Algorithm Fairness
**Solution**: Implement a transparent and verifiable random selection process that properly weights entries based on additional purchased chances.

### Challenge 2: Concurrent Participation
**Solution**: Implement proper database locking and transaction handling to prevent race conditions during participation and APoints purchases.

### Challenge 3: System Gaming
**Solution**: Implement participation logging and monitoring systems to detect and prevent system abuse.

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Multiple question types (beyond multiple choice)
- Social sharing features
- Achievement/badge system
- Public winner's page
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app version
- Integration with additional payment systems
- Automated raffle scheduling system
- Migration to a more robust database system if needed
